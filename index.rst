   .. note::

      If you use OpenSeesPy, I would like very much to hear from you. A short email to
      `zhum@oregonstate.edu <zhum@oregonstate.edu>`_
      describing who you are and how you use OpenSeesPy will mean a lot to me.
      I can justify spending time on improvements that I hope will benefit you.


.. note::

   Please send any questions to `github issues <https://github.com/zhuminjie/OpenSeesPyDoc/issues>`_.

   You are very welcome to contribute to OpenSeesPy with new command
   documents and examples
   by sending pull requests
   through `github pulls <https://github.com/zhuminjie/OpenSeesPyDoc/pulls>`_.


========================
 The OpenSeesPy Library
========================
`OpenSeesPy`_ is a `Python 3`_ interpreter of `OpenSees`_.
A minimum script is shown below:

::

   # import opensees
   import openseespy.opensees as ops

   # wipe model
   ops.wipe()
   

Most of `OpenSeesPy`_ commands have the same syntax and arguments as the
OpenSees `Tcl commands <http://opensees.berkeley.edu/wiki/index.php/Command_Manual>`_.
The conversion from Tcl to Python is easy and straightforward
as demonstrated with commands below.
